Drive Light is a small utility application with only one single goal in mind; to display
drive activity in the taskbar. It came about as a result of long term frustration over
computers that I've had before that either didn't have a drive activity light, or were
located in places where the light wasn't visible. Drive Light monitors all HDD/SSD drives
installed on your system, and displays one of four different icons, depending on what your
drives are doing. These icons are:

1.) a "neutral" square with a grey background - Indicated no drive activity
2.) a green square - indicates disk reads
3.) a red square - indicates disk writes
4.) a yellow square - indicates concurrent read/write activity

Drive Light uses almost negligable resources, and has a tiny footprint (116KB executable file size).
It currently has/requires no configuration, and will (or at least should) run on any Windows OS that
supports .NET framework 4.0 - I've tested it with Windows XP 32 bit SP3, Windows 7 64 bit, and Windows
8 Pro 64 bit. Plans for future versions include the option to use 'alternative' icons, but that's
something that will be explored at a later time.
